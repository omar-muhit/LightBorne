🌌 Game Title: LightBorne: The Echo of Flame
Genre: Text Adventure | Fantasy | Morality-Based Quest
🌠 THE CORE STORY (YOUR STORY, TRANSFORMED INTO MYTH)
In the once-luminous kingdom of Elyndor, a boy was born under a radiant sky—promised to be the protector of light. But darkness crept in, seeded by greed, betrayal, and silence. The boy, cast aside, abused, and unbelieved, carried pain in silence while the kingdom fell to shadow.

That boy is you.
You awaken in the shattered world, stripped of hope, but not of purpose. The Flame still lives inside you.

You are now the LightBorne — the last vessel of Elyndor’s spark. You must traverse six deadly realms, solve ancient riddles, answer impossible moral questions, and recover lost Artifacts of Light, each tied to your soul and integrity. These artifacts, when united, can restore the altar of flame... or doom it to eternal darkness.

🧭 GAME STRUCTURE & FLOW
The game consists of 6 primary realms, each with:

Narration: Describes environment and lore.

Moral Dilemma: A hard ethical question that determines if the artifact is earned.

Realm Challenge: A riddle or puzzle to continue.

Mini-boss (optional): Optional encounter with risk/reward.

Secret Room (if quick enough): Grants powers like flame or shield.

Dynamic Outcomes: Based on artifact count, choices, randomness.

✨ Non-linear Design
Each playthrough randomizes riddle outcomes, moral questions, and artifact availability.

Players can revisit past realms if they lack artifacts before the final boss.

Optional events (boss fights, bonus trials) can be skipped or faced.

Battle Mechanics:

If you collected 0–1 artifacts, you can go back or face a hard boss battle.

If you collected 2–3, the fight is winnable but risky.

If you collected 4–5, you gain damage bonuses.

If you have all 6, you unlock a secret Light Channeling move.

Final choice: Fight or speak? Your actions, points, and relics all affect outcome.

🧠 MORAL QUESTIONS (EXAMPLES)
Each realm’s artifact is unlocked only by answering one of the following hard moral dilemmas:

“Would you endure lifelong pain to prevent one moment of someone else's death?”

“Is mercy a weakness or a strength when faced with betrayal?”

“If the truth will break someone you love, is it better to lie?”

All choices are stored to change the world state and increase replayability.
